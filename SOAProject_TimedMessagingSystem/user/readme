All the testing programs must be run after sudoing.


The program writer.c receives 2 params in input:
1) a pathname of the device file handled by device driver
2) a write timeout expressed in seconds
Writer can insert message that will be posted in device file after the write timeout specified. 
With the messages:
-REVOKE_DELAYED_MESSAGES: the delayed messages are revoked 
-CLOSE: close the file descriptor and exit. The delayed messages are revoked.


The program reader.c receives 2 parameters:
1) a pathname of the device file handled by device driver
2) a read timeout expessed in seconds
Reader can read messages posted in the device file by writer. 


The program readerAndWriterConcurrency.c receives 4 parameters:
1) pathname of the device file handled by device driver
2) major number that allows to create the device file
3) write timeout expressed in seconds
4) read timeout expessed in seconds
This program create the device file with function mknod(), set send and receive timeout and create reader and writer threads. 
The reader thread, in an infinite loop try to read the messages posted by writers.
The writer thread posted a message in which he writes its id.
In default configurations we have 20 writers and 5 readers. 
The read timeout must be greater than write timeout. If write timeout is greater than read timeout, the two values are switched.
